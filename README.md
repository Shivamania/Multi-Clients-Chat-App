# Multi-Clients Chat App

## Project Overview
The **Multi-Clients Chat App** is a versatile and user-friendly chat application developed using **Java Socket Programming** and **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project facilitates seamless, real-time communication between multiple users over a network. By leveraging Java's robust networking and GUI capabilities, the app aims to enhance user experience and foster efficient collaboration.

## Features
- Real-time chat between multiple clients over a network.
- TCP/IP socket connections for communication.
- User-friendly GUI built with Java Swing.
- Server-client architecture to manage multiple users.
- Efficient message exchange without lag.

## Tools and Technologies Used

### Software Requirements:
- **Programming Language:**
  - **Java**: Used for both server-side and client-side development. The application is built using **Java Standard Edition (SE)**.
  
- **Socket Programming in Java**:
  - Utilized **Java's built-in networking API** to implement socket programming for establishing TCP/IP connections, enabling real-time message exchange between users.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - **Java Swing**: A GUI toolkit for creating window-based applications. The appâ€™s user interface is developed using Swing, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**:
  - **IntelliJ IDEA**: An advanced IDE for Java development. It supports code completion, debugging, and project management to streamline the development process.

### Hardware Requirements:
- **Personal Computer or Laptop**: Capable of running Java development tools efficiently.
- **Processing Power**: Adequate CPU and memory to compile and test Java code effectively.
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Java development tools (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## How It Works
- **Server**: The server starts and listens for client connections. Once a client is connected, the server facilitates real-time message exchange between all connected clients.
- **Client**: The client connects to the server, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time.
